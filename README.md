Hello. 

I like to spend the majority of my time coding and thinking outside of the box. I enjoy things related to game development and web development. I find the two topics very interesting and fun. I am currently pursuing a career as a Full-Stack Web Developer.


This is where I put some of my public code. This would include things I have just learned,
have worked on, sharing to the public, etc.
